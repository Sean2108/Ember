# Ember

Project Overview
Our project “Ember” is a mobile application which provides a platform for the elderly of our society to expand
their social circle, where they can interact and mingle with other elderlies. Our aim would be to reduce the
number of elderlies who are lonely, preventing from slipping into depression. With information on their
interests and hobbies, we would be making use of a matchmaking algorithm in order to match them with
people who are similar to themselves, and hopefully with good chemistry.

Project Description and Scope
“Ember” is a project that was taken in collaboration with Lions Befrienders Singapore, a social service
organisation whose mission is to provide friendship and care for seniors to age in a community with
community participation, enabling them to enjoy meaningful and enriching lives.
The basis of “Ember” would be to make use of user’s interests, hobbies, locations and other details in order
to match them with another user of similar interests. The idea behind it is to ensure that they have a common
interest, which would lead to a topic to talk about which they can further expand from there.
The system will return a list of “matches” of other users with similar interests, in which user can choose which
user they would like. In the event where both users have indicated interest in each other, system will send out
a notification to inform them, and open a chatroom for them where they can chat with each other.
The user interface will include all necessary user interfaces to quickly and determine the user’s requirements
and preferences. However, the system will have no method of validating whether information is valid or
invalid and validity of details would remain up to the user.
